# Scooby Doo TCG

> Welcome to Langley's Scooby Doo TCG repository!

## About
First and foremost, this repository serves as my own personal playground for learning PostgreSQL, Java Spring, and Vue 2.

The "Scooby Doo TCG" itself is intended to be a dupe of [the FiGPiN App](https://figpin.com/pages/the-all-new-figpin-app).  I was originally inspired to create this dupe after attempting the gain employment with FiGPiN in the Fall of 2022, to no avail.  Through my work on this project, I've learned a lot about full-stack app development and why they turned me down. 🙂

If you decide to run this code, please keep in mind that most features have not been fully fleshed out.

If you decide to read the code, please keep in mind that some features were implemented for the sole purpose of practicing design patterns and development strategies.
